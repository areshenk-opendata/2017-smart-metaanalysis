# smartMetaAnalysis
Data and code for replicating the meta-analysis reported in Smart et al. (2017).
The file 'data/masterSpreadsheet.csv' reports raw outcomes reported by the studies
included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis models are located in the 'models'
folder.

The script 'runMetaAnalysis.R' runs the complete analysis, from the importing and preparation
of the raw data in 'data/masterSpreadsheet.csv', to the plotting of the fitted model. More
details are found within the '.R' files.

Currently, the code only replicates the cognitive outcome model. Code for the full model
is forthcoming.
